# Arachnea Scrapyfy

`arachnea-scrapyfy` contains the generic scraping engine used by Arachnea.

## Responsibilities

- Define scraper query models for HTML and JSON sources.
- Execute configured queries through the shared HTTP client.
- Apply scraper actions and post-processors.
- Load and aggregate query collections from source configuration files.

## Notes

Keep source-specific response shaping in YAML actions or generic post-processors whenever possible. Service-specific Rust should remain limited to behavior that cannot be expressed generically.
