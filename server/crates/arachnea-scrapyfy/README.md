# Arachnea Scrapyfy

`arachnea-scrapyfy` contains the generic scraping engine used by Arachnea.

## Proxy Provider Lifetime

Proxy and IP-country data providers own independent snapshots of their source
manifests and effective activation settings. They do not borrow the application
aggregator, so replacing it cannot invalidate an in-flight provider request.
Provider runtimes share persistence and local-country state, but use a separate
system-proxy handle to avoid an ownership cycle with the dynamic proxy core.
Applications must publish a newly built core on reload to apply changed sources;
proxy lists are still loaded lazily for country-based requests.

## Responsibilities

- Define scraper query models for HTML and JSON sources.
- Execute configured queries through the shared HTTP client.
- Apply scraper actions and post-processors.
- Load and aggregate query collections from source configuration files.

## Notes

Keep source-specific response shaping in YAML actions or generic post-processors whenever possible. Service-specific Rust should remain limited to behavior that cannot be expressed generically.
